# The DJ Set Tracker

Growing up, I was always intrigued by Electronic Dance Music (EDM). What makes the EDM scene so unique and fascinating is the constant access to new and never-before-heard music through DJ and producer performances uploaded to YouTube.

Over the past year, I noticed a major issue: uploads from my favorite artists were extremely decentralized. While DJ performances are sometimes posted on the artist’s own YouTube channel, that’s often not the case. Sets can appear on a festival’s channel, a venue or nightclub’s channel, a radio show’s channel, or even on third-party outlets that host guest mixes.

Because these uploads are scattered across so many sources, I took the initiative to develop a cross-platform mobile application using React Native that tracks and notifies users whenever a new performance is posted by one of their favorite artists.

Below you can click on the screenshot and it will direct you to a walkthrough of what I have so far on YouTube.
